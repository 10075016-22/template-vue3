##  Project setup

Before executing the run command in local environment it is essential to perform the following configuration.

1. Create an `.env` file with the following structure

```.env
VITE_BASE_API=http://localhost:8000
```
> Important to start with `VITE_` so that it can be interpreted by Vue's _CLI_, in this case it is used for the base API configuration.

## Run locally
```
npm run dev
```

You must have previously installed the dependencies, for this you can use the command:

```
npm install
```
